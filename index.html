                <p class="about-me">
                    Hi there! My name is <strong>Husky</strong>, and I am a Web Developer and Ethical Hacker. I have been working in this field for 2 years now in Web Developer and 5 years in Cybersecurity, and I am truly passionate about what I do.<br>
                    <br>
                    As a web developer, my primary responsibility is to design and develop websites that are user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and functional. I work closely with clients to understand their needs and requirements, and I use my expertise in programming languages like <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP</strong> to create customized solutions that meet their unique needs.<br>
                    <br>
                    One of the things I enjoy most about being a web developer is the creative aspect of the job. Every website is different, and I love the challenge of coming up with unique designs and innovative solutions that help my clients stand out from their competitors.<br>
                    <br>
                    In the field of cybersecurity I have been working  for the past 5 years. I am extremely passionate about my work and love the challenge of staying one step ahead of cyber attackers.<br>
                    <br>
                    In my work, I follow a <strong>Strict Methodology</strong> that includes thorough testing, analysis, and reporting of any vulnerabilities I discover. I am constantly learning and keeping up-to-date with the latest threats and vulnerabilities in the cybersecurity landscape. I am passionate about making the digital world a safer place and believe that my work in the field of cybersecurity is helping to achieve that goal.<br>
                    <br>
                    Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects and have come across some interesting <strong>CVE's</strong> (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). Let me share some of my experiences with you:<br>
                    <br>
            <ul class="discover">
                <li class="cve">
                    <strong style="text-shadow: 0px 0px 15px red;"><a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-1234/" target="_blank">CVE-2020-1234</a></strong> This was a critical vulnerability I found in a popular e-commerce website. Through my testing and analysis, I discovered that the website's authentication mechanism was not secure enough, which allowed attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive customer data. I reported this vulnerability to the website's administrators and worked with them to patch the issue.<br>
                </li>
                    <br>
                <li class="cve">
                    <strong style="text-shadow: 0px 0px 15px red;"><a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-5678" target="_blank">CVE-2019-5678</a></strong> During a penetration testing engagement for a financial institution, I found a vulnerability in their mobile banking application that allowed attackers to perform unauthorized transactions. This was due to a lack of proper input validation, which allowed malicious actors to manipulate transaction data. I presented my findings to the institution's security team and provided recommendations for remediation.<br>
                </li>
                    <br>
                <li class="cve">
                    <strong style="text-shadow: 0px 0px 15px red;"><a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2021-42321/" target="_blank">CVE-2021-4321</a></strong> I discovered a vulnerability in a cloud-based storage service that could have potentially allowed attackers to access confidential data stored by the service's customers. The vulnerability was related to weak encryption protocols used by the service, which made it easy for attackers to bypass security measures. I reported this vulnerability to the service provider and worked with them to implement stronger encryption protocols.<br>
                </li>
                    <br>
                <li class="cve">
                    <strong style="text-shadow: 0px 0px 15px red;"><a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-9999" target="_blank">CVE-2018-9999</a></strong> This was a vulnerability I found in a network security appliance that allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on the appliance. Through careful analysis of the appliance's firmware, I discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access. I reported this vulnerability to the manufacturer and provided guidance on how to patch the issue.<br>
